# online boards
The goal is to have fun while making an online board games solution.


Frontend: React or Vue
Backend: .NET Core (eventually Python?)
DB: document DBs, so NoSQL

Patterns: "microservices" in the sense that each services holds his domain
I thought about these 3 to start
- account service: sign in (with google, fb, twitter, ms), sign-out, profile
- game service: where the logic of a game is, depending on the game complexity we may want != services
- chat service: chat friends, chat game opponents, global chat?

We can provide board games, card games, etc
It's better to start with some that are easy to implement
